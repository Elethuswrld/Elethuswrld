- 👋 Hi, I’m @Elethuswrld
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development, or let me just say anything that includes coding as work.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying to become a Software Development, but that's not all when im done with studying this course i want to venture more on programming languages to increase my knowledge as an upcoming Coder.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with people so that I can grow as a person who has dreams and goals to chase on this industry.
- 📫 You can reach me by sending a text on my email: Elethuelza03@gmail.com
